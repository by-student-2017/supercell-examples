[ENTER EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION HERE]
Supercell should be installed. PWscf should be in PATH. Run script df_cfg_qe_gc.bash.

!./df_cfg_qe_gc.bash XxYxZ N

e.g., 1x1x2 supercell and 4 CPUs

!./df_cfg_qe_gc.bash 1x1x2 4

The command used to generate supercells in this case is:

!supercell -i PbSnTe.cif -s 1x1x2 -m -v 2 -o [OUTPUT DIRECTORY]/PbSnTe_1x1x2 &

Note that the [OUTPUT DIRECTORY] should exist when running the command.
The analysis is then performed with the PWscf program.
